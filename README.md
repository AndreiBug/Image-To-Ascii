# ASCII Grayscale Image Converter

This project processes and converts an input image into an ASCII art representation based on pixel intensity values. The program downsamples the image, converts it to grayscale, and maps pixel intensity ranges to specific ASCII characters for a creative text-based visualization.

---

## Features
- **Image Resizing**: Reduces the resolution of the image for more manageable ASCII rendering.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Automatically converts images to grayscale if they are in color.
- **ASCII Mapping**: Maps pixel intensity ranges to different ASCII characters, providing a visual representation of the image.
- **Customizable Intensity Ranges**: Easy to update the ASCII mappings for different visual effects.

## ASCII Character Mapping

The following ASCII characters represent different intensity ranges:

- `\#` for darkest pixels.
- X % & * + / ( ' and space for increasing brightness.

You can customize the mapping by adjusting the ranges in the script.
